# SQL Data Analysis: Exploring Pizza Sales Data

**Introduction**
Hi there! I'm thrilled to share the findings of my project on pizza sales data analysis. Using a variety of SQL queries, I examined a large dataset that included specifics about pizza orders, such as order details, pizza category, size, quantity, prices, and order dates. For this project, I investigated sales data related to pizza. My objective was to use SQL to obtain important information about sales patterns, average order value, top-selling pizzas, and overall revenue.

**Problem Statement**
In order to maximize its commercial plans, the pizza shop seeks to comprehend important facets of its sales statistics. Among the particular queries we aim to answer are:
1. What is the total revenue generated from pizza sales?
2. What is the average order value for pizza purchases?
3. How many pizzas have been sold in total?
4. How many unique orders have been placed?
5. What is the average number of pizzas sold per order?
