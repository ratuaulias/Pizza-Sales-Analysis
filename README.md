SQL Data Analysis: Exploring Pizza Sales Data
Introduction
Hi there! I'm thrilled to share the findings of my project on pizza sales data analysis. Using a variety of SQL queries, I examined a large dataset that included specifics about pizza orders, such as order details, pizza category, size, quantity, prices, and order dates. For this project, I investigated sales data related to pizza. My objective was to use SQL to obtain important information about sales patterns, average order value, top-selling pizzas, and overall revenue.
